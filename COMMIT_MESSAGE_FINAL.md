feat: Add comprehensive pixel art and image conversion capabilities with optimized build system

This major update introduces complete pixel art functionality and image processing
capabilities to the PixelMug MCP system, along with significant build system
improvements for better reliability and maintainability.

### üé® New Features: Pixel Art Display System

#### pixel_art Action
- Support for multiple pixel formats:
  * Hex color arrays: [["#FF0000", "#00FF00"], ["#0000FF", "#FFFFFF"]]
  * RGB tuple arrays: [[[255,0,0], [0,255,0]], [[0,0,255], [255,255,255]]]
  * Base64 encoded image data
- Configurable display dimensions (1x1 to 128x128 pixels)
- Duration control for display timing (1-3600 seconds)
- Built-in pattern library with predefined examples:
  * 8x8 smiley face, heart shape, coffee cup
  * Multiple geometric patterns (checkboard, target, diamond, star)
  * Coffee-themed patterns (bean, steam effects)

#### convert_image_to_pixels Method
- Convert base64 encoded images (PNG/JPEG) to pixel matrices
- Multiple resize algorithms: nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic
- Intelligent fallback when PIL unavailable (hash-based pattern generation)
- Comprehensive conversion metadata:
  * Original and target dimensions
  * Resize method used
  * Pixel count and format information
  * Performance statistics

### üîß Enhanced MCP Protocol Support

#### Updated JSON-RPC Methods
- Extended help method with complete pixel art documentation
